This section covers how Hive Society plays and performs. More specifically, it covers sets, games, warmups, and exercises. 

**[Sets](sets/sets.md)**. Sets are the core of what Hive Society does. They are the show-grade long-form structure that a team uses to perform. Think *Middleditch and Schwartz* on Netflix. A set is typically 15-30 minutes long and built around a structured series of scenes that are usually at least tangentially connected.

**Games**. Games are short-form improv. This is the domain of groups like Spicy Clamato, Odd Request, and Phoenix Improv Company; and shows like *Whose Line is it Anyway*. These are usually very specifically structured and are less grounded than sets. Games are useful for practice because:

- They're fun
- They can help develop specific improv skills (as in, "we need to work on object work, so let's play Party Quirks")
- They're short, so you can run multiple games in a practice to get everyone involved

**Warmups**. Warmups are the exercises that Hive uses to get ready for a show or practice. They're designed to get everyone in the right headspace for improv. They're usually high-energy and silly, and are a great way to get everyone feeling loose and ready to play. Warmups should happen before all improvâ€”they're a great way to get out of your head and into the moment. They should last about 7-10 minutes and leave everyone feeling more high-energy than they walked in.

**Exercises**. Exercises are activities used to develop improv skills and principles. Games can be used as exercises, but not all exercises are games. Some exercises are weird and used to drive home specific points. 

Exercises should be catered to the team's needs. Every team is different and might be excelling or lacking in different areas. For example, if a team is struggling with object work, maybe make them do a pantomime exercise, or if they are struggling with coming up with new ideas make them play New Choice. Many exercises have been designed with the issues a past team had in mind, and might not be useful for your team.

A lot of exercises are just two-person scenes with a twist. Others are group activities, usually with everyone in a circle or on stage.
