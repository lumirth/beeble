An armando is a sweep-based[^1] set built around monologues. Because of the rigid structure the set provides, armandos are a great option for new improvisors. The general structure is as follows:

---

*Audience suggestion (usually of 'grab-bag anything') is taken.*

**Monologue** (•) ~1m
- A performer walks up and monologues about just about anything, can be unrelated to the suggestion
  - Options include telling a story from your life, waxing poetically, rambling in-character, interacting with the crowd, complaining about your job, etc.
- The mologue can be built on for the subsequent scenes, or entirely ignored
  - If the monologue was a story, subsequent scenes can be a reenacting of the story, inspired by themes or ideas in the story, or completely unrelated"

**Source scenes** (•••) ~2m x 3 = ~6m
- Only 2 people should be in each of these first scenes
- Meant to establish the base reality to be later built upon and called back to
- Ideally as unrelated to each other as reasonably possible
- Each scene should be a different pair of performers/characters

**Monologue** (•) ~1m
- The person who sweeps the last source scene must monologue

**Source scenes** (•••) ~2m x 3 = ~6m
- Are not strictly required to be 2-person scenes
- Should expand upon the first three scenes
- Can begin to have callbacks, though generally only one
- These should have different improvisers to the preceding set
- At least one scene should be new and unrelated to avoid being pigeon-holed

**Monologue** (•) ~1m
- The person who sweeps the last source scene must monologue

**The Run** (•...) ~6m
- Strict structure falls away—build upon preceding ideas, do callbacks, explore
- Build in energy running up to the end
- Scenes should get shorter as the set goes on
- The source scenes don't necessarily have to come back, but if they do make sure they escalate to a conclusion

Total: ~20m

The first and most important reminder: 1 + 2 = 3. It has been a running issue for the first source scene to get accidentally sweeeped early because the performers forget to account for the monologue in the timer. The monologue lasts a minute, the first scene lasts two—thus, the first sweep should happen around three minutes in. 

[^1]: Scenes are ended by a performer running across the stage while shouting "Sweep!" and then starting a new scene. The people in the scene they are sweeping leave the stage. The person who swept then becomes a part of the new scene.
