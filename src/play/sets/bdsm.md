# Bear Dog Shark Mouse (BDSM)

> "It's called 'Bear Dog Shark Mouse' because those are the only animals that can clap! —Also don't think about the acronym too much."

> \- Hive Society, many a time

BDSM is performed as one great big chain of tag outs. The broad idea is as follows:

---

- Audience suggestion (often of 'grab-bag anything') is taken.
- Performers stand in a line
- Two performers move onto the stage to begin the first scene
- Anybody in the line can clap to freeze the scene to tag somebody out
  - The performer who remained is generally expected to maintain their previous character, though the context or setting may differ
    - Performers can—but are not required to—be the same character when returning to the scene after being tagged out
  - The new scene does not necessarily have to be related, though often is
  - If two people clap at once, both enter the scene
- Performers may enter the scene without clapping, acting as a new (to the scene) character
  - Performers are allowed to tag multiple people out at once, though this is only done when the scene has 3+ people.
- The first few scenes are traditionally longer(~2m) to allow for more material to expand upon later

### Patterns

BDSM is a crowd favorite in Hive(meaning, favorite to us improvisers) because of how easy it makes it to get a laugh. It also allows you to pay a little less attention because you can create an awesome scene from only the immediately preceding scene. This is in contrast to, say, a [Small Town](small-town.md), where one must remember quite a bit about each character and what came before.

Take the following example:

> Suggestion: **Webkins**
>
> - First scene involves two characters haggling over the price of a hippo stuffed animal. 
>   - A: "Well, fine, I'll sell it to you for five dollars."
>   - B: "I'll take that deal. Man, this hippo is awesome."
>   - A: "Wait, I want it back. Can I pay you for it? I think four dollars is fair."
>   - B: "Are you kidding? I'd need at least six dollars for it!"
> - Performer C promptly claps and tags out Performer A. He stands on the chair and assumes a sort of crouched hunchback position.
>   - C: "Six dollars, really? I'm worth way more than that, man."

In this example, C took the mention of the hippo's stuffed animal and its price as inspiration for personifying the animal. This might then be followed by an offhand mention of B's dad, upon which D might tag out B and play out a new scene acting as the father, and so on. 

BDSMs are characterized by fast-paced tag outs that end up exploring the world through connections to an original pair of characters. Offhand comments become the thrust of entire new scenes and arcs, and half the time when some outlandish action is mentioned, the next scene will almost certainly be someone taking that action. 

BDSMs have a unique ability to wow the audience, and feel akin to a magically rambling train of thought that sails into the distance. Consequently, they might struggle with feeling grounded or with developing particular characters, ideas, and storylines fully. It's not uncommon for a BDSM to completely runaway from its source scenes and struggle to call back to them. Good news is, though: BDSMs still manage to be remarkably entertaining even with those struggles.
