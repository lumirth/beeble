# Small Town

A small town is a relatively unstructured sweep-based[^1] set that functions using a few key rules. The idea is as follows:

- An audience suggestion of a location that can fit on stage is taken.
- A performer can only ever take up one character for the entire set
  - Once they are that character, they cannot switch or change their character, and must maintain it throughout
- All characters know each other

[^1:]: Scenes are initiated by a performer running across the stage while shouting "Sweep!" and then starting a new scene. The people in the scene they are sweeping leave the stage. The person who swept then becomes a part of the new scene.
