# Quickstart

Welcome to the Beeble, the Hive Society handbook. Contained within this document are many useful things, some of which you may want to jump directly to. Here are some quick links to get you started:

- [Introduction](introduction.md) - A brief overview of Hive Society and the Beeble
- [Sets](play/sets/sets.md) - Detailed descriptions of each Hive set

This document is currently a **work in progress**. Everything is subject to change and nothing is set in stone. Eventually, the document should coalesce into the first edition: The Hively Beebly 2024. If you have any suggestions, ideas, questions, concerns, or contributions, please tell me posthaste. Perchance. â€” Kukas
