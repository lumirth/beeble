# Introduction

This is "The Hively Beeble", or just "The Beeble", a living document meant to be the definitive handbook and guide *by* and *for* Hive Society Improv. This section will give you a brief overview of what Hive Society is, what the Beeble is, and how to use it.

## What is Hive Society?

"Hive Society" is a long-form improvisational comedy group on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus. It's full title is "Hive Society Improv", though it is often referred to as just "Hive". 

Hive differs from other improv groups in two main ways:

- Hive is a **long form** group.
  - *Other improv groups* usually play shorter games, in the range of 2-5 minutes
  - Hive plays longer games, usually around 15-20 minutes. 
- Hive is **multiple teams**. 
  - *Other groups* traditionally have ~8-15 members and function as one single unit, where new members audition to replace graduating seniors.
  - Hive auditions an **entirely new team** each time it hosts auditions. At any given time, Hive may have up to four teams. 
    - Note: teams can be made up of people from any year—seniors can just as easily be on the 1st year team as the 4th.

What does this mean in practice? Well:

**More people get to do improv**. Before Hive Society, UIUC's improv scene effectively topped out at ~50 people. That means only ~50 people  get to do improv on a ~50,000 person campus—or, in other words, only *one in ten thousand* people get the chance to do one of the most enriching activities on campus. Hive makes improv remarkably more accessible to the student body.

**A better introduction to improv**. Through direct coaching, along with having multiple teams worth of improvisational insight at its disposal, Hive gives new improvisers the best possible introduction to the craft.

**Strength in diversity.** With up to four teams worth of people at any given time, Hive has the most individual minds of any group. Each team brings its own unique and dynamic twist to the craft.

## What is the Beeble?
Hive, due to its unique structure, has a lot of knowledge that needs to get passed down from team to team. In the past, this knowledge and wisdom has often slipped out of the group's collective memory; at one point, the origins of the group were simply lost to time. Fortunately, this knowledge was recovered through a sustained effort to reach out and connect with the group's alumni. Following this, it was decided that it was important to create some sort of persistent record—a living document that would serve as an archive of the what the group has learned and as a guide for future teams. That record is this document—the Hively Beeble.

### How do I use the Beeble?
**Treat the Beeble as a living document**. It is meant to be updated and changed as the group learns and grows. It is meant to be a guide for new teams, and a reference for old ones. It is meant to serve as both anchor and compass, connecting us to our roots and values and guiding us towards our future. 

**Don't take the Beeble as gospel**. Despite its name, under no circumstances should the Beeble be treated as a holy text. It is not a set of commandments, nor is it a set of laws. It is a guide, a repository of wisdom, and a retelling of Hive's story. We, the authors, are not infallible, and we do not know everything. We're just like you: improvisers doing our best. We are not the final word on anything. We are simply the current word. Your job, as a reader, is to take what we say and make it better.

**Review and rewrite**. Ideally, The Beeble should be reviewed and updated on a yearly basis, probably in the spring semester. In updating it, try to balance understanding/respect for the care that those before you put into it with the need to revise and expand upon it. We, the authors, are not infallible, but that doesn't mean we didn't put thought into what we wrote. You shouldn't change things recklessly, but you *should* change things. The Beeble should reflect Hive. Did one game fall out of fashion in favor of another? Did you find new, better insight into a game that we didn't have? Did we phrase something in a way that was unclear or unhelpful? Change it, but change it thoughtfully.

Remember, the Beeble will never be finished. It will never be perfect. Take it into your hands and leave your mark, and let the next generation do the same.
